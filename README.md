# Classification-of-plant-species-based-on-leaf-images.
In this study, we explore the fascinating intersection of botany and machine learning, 
focusing on the classification of plant species based on leaf images. Our work is 
grounded in the utilization of the Leaf Classification dataset, which features 
approximately 1,584 images of leaf specimens across 99 species. Each specimen is 
represented through binary black-and-white images, complemented by three distinct 
sets of features: shape, interior texture, and fine-scale margin histograms, 
encapsulating the complexity and diversity of plant leaf structures. Leveraging the 
capabilities of a 3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, our approach is 
tailored to navigate the challenges of species identification through leaf analysis. 
The model architecture—consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer with tanh 
activation, and an output layer—is meticulously crafted to capture the nuances of 
leaf patterns. Through a comprehensive exploration of hyperparameters, including 
batch sizes, hidden sizes, dropout rates, optimizers, and learning rates, we aim not 
only to optimize the model’s performance but also to gain deeper insights into the 
dataset's inherent characteristics.
